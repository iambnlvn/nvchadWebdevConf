# Project Name

[NvChad](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad) config for web dev

# Why

Web dev config for NvChad(nvim), including Tailwind css, TS and Golang LSPs,formatters & linters...
(In case I had to use someone else's machine which prolly uses vs code, I can just clone this repo, plus I'm too lazy to configure, maybe a skill issue tho)

# Usage

Basically, clone this repo and launch nvim
